            Sancho, born in 2000, celebrated his 21st birthday on the 25th. The analyst, a statistical media outlet, posted a long article saying, "Sancho is ready to dominate European football."
            
            According to the media, Sancho has the most offensive points in the league since 1992 as an English player under the age of 21.
            Sancho scored 36 goals and 43 assists in 99 league games, accumulating 79 attack points, the highest record in the past 30 years.

            Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney was fourth with 66 offensive points with 44 goals and 22 assists.
